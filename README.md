# Arduino-Motion-Sensor-Project

 A simple project using Arduino Mega 2560 R3 to control HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor Module, LCD 1602 Module, a passive buzzer and 2 LEDs. 
 Essentially, when motion is detected, it prints a blinking message on LCD screen and activates both the buzzer and flashing LEDs.
